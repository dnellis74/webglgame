# webglgame
Scratch bucket for a web game.

## What
A demo of animation and timemap collisions

## Caveats
Currently, the "hierarchy" doesn't save succesfully, so you have to recreate that when you clone

## Where
The build can be found at [https://dnellis74.github.io/webglgame/web-build/](https://dnellis74.github.io/webglgame/web-build/)
